# UV-Based Disinfection Technologies 

An innovative approach to maintaining sufficient stocks of N-95 and surgical masks, and other disposable protective equipment, is to find a method that would allow the safe and hygienic reuse of this equipment. This is primarily a question of disinfecting the equipment without degrading its protective capabilities.

This solution could allow equipment to be used up to four times, instead of just once. Examples of equipment that could be sterilised in this way include:

* N-95 and surgical masks
* Face shields
* Full-body protective Hazmat suits
* Head covers

Technical approach
---------------------

Our research has shown that UV-Type C LED lights offer a powerful means of sterilisation through ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. The short-wavelength UV-C light kills or deactivates the virus by destroying its nucleic acids and disrupting its DNA. By running the PPE equipment under the UV-C light, the COVID-19 virus on these surfaces is destroyed.

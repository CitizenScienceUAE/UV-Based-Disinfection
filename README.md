# UV-Based-Disinfection

A DIY UV-C Sterilizer, Designed to Disinfect Everything from Face Masks to Cell-Phones 

With the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases, a shortage in medical PPE is becoming a concern. This is mainly since the protection gear is of single use. Therefore, being able to re-use them will help avoid this shortage. This could be done through disinfecting the equipment used.  A very common method of disinfection is UV-C waves. These UV waves are known for their germicidal abilities. After exposing viruses and germs to these waves for a certain amount of time, they will be inactivated and unable to reproduce. With the use of UVC lamps, aluminum and a compact box, a disinfection chamber could be created for that purpose. It is a quite simple concept, which is very effective and simple enough to DIY. The internal surface of the box is covered in aluminum in order to make sure that the UV light is reflected on all parts of the infected object. After that, UVC lamps are placed in a box based on the required dose and intensity. The infected part is to be placed in a box for a certain period, until it is disinfected and ready to be reused.  This does not only apply to medical PPE, but also other equipment which are more prone to infection such as cell-phones.....etc

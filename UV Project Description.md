# A DIY UV-C Sterilizer, Designed to Disinfect Everything from Face Masks to Cell-Phones 

With the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases, a shortage in medical PPE is becoming a concern. This is mainly since the protection gear is of single use. Therefore, being able to re-use them will help avoid this shortage. This could be done through disinfecting the equipment used.  A very common method of disinfection is UV-C waves. These UV waves are known for their germicidal abilities. After exposing viruses and germs to these waves for a certain amount of time, they will be inactivated and unable to reproduce. With the use of UVC lamps, aluminum and a compact box, a disinfection chamber could be created for that purpose. It is a quite simple concept, which is very effective and simple enough to DIY. The internal surface of the box is covered in aluminum in order to make sure that the UV light is reflected on all parts of the infected object. After that, UVC lamps are placed in a box based on the required dose and intensity. The infected part is to be placed in a box for a certain period, until it is disinfected and ready to be reused.  This does not only apply to medical PPE, but also other equipment which are more prone to infection such as cell-phones.....etc 
### 1.What is the benefit of using of this technology?
##### a) Describe the need 
COVID-19 cases have exceeded 1.1 million cases worldwide and the healthcare workers depend on PPE to protect themselves and other patients from any infections. [6MM] Due to the high number of cases, there is a shortage of PPE in several countries such as the United States and Italy which puts the frontline workers at risk. [7MM] These PPE’s include face masks, protection gowns, goggles, etc. Many of this equipment is of single-use and in order to avoid any shortage, they could be reused after disinfection.
##### b) Benefits & Comparative advantages 
Ultraviolet light is emitted by our Sun, however most of the mid and higher range wavelengths are blocked by ozone gas in our atmosphere. There are 3 types of it, UV-A, UV-B and UV-C, which is the type used for disinfections. The properties of these waves allow them to disrupt the germs and viruses which makes them act as sterilizers. When viruses are exposed to the germicidal wavelengths of UVC light, they are become incapable of reproducing and infecting. UVC light has demonstrated effectiveness against pathogenic organisms, including those responsible for viral and parasitic diseases. Moreover, experiments show that UV type C is a sufficient way for disinfecting medical and pharmaceutical equipment. [4MM] It is a known disinfectant for air, water and surfaces which could assist in avoiding any COVID-19 disinfections.
##### c) Describe the limitations or risks
At a larger scale, this method could be more challenging since surfaces which are not directly exposed to the UV-C emitter would experience a less efficient disinfection. [4MM] Other factors such as distance and energy also have an impact of the effectiveness of this method of disinfection.
##### d) What are some health effects of exposure to UV radiation?
Some UV exposure is essential for good health. It stimulates vitamin D production in the body. In medical practice, one example is UV lamps can be used for treating psoriasis (a condition causing itchy, scaly red patches on the skin).
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation is associated with different types of skin cancer, sunburn, accelerated skin aging, as well as cataracts and other eye diseases. The severity of the effect depends on the wavelength (see Figure 2 in section 5), intensity, and duration of exposure.
### 2. High level description of the use case scenario
##### a) How is this technology going to be used?
Ultraviolet light is split into several different ranges: (near the visible light range) UV-A, UV-B, UV-C, Vacuum-UV (near the x-ray range). The UV-B range is what causes sunburn on humans. UV water purifiers use the UV-C range because of its germicidal abilities. In this range the light will break molecular bonds in the DNA of viruses and bacteria, rendering them unable to reproduce and effectively killing them. Therefore, a disinfection chamber can be created by placing UV-C emitters at a specified location in a box at which PPE could be placed and completely exposed to the light for disinfection. 
##### b) Where is it going to be used?
This technology is generally used for air, water and wastewater disinfection and treatment as well as laboratory hygiene and food and beverage protection. This shows that it is effectively used in different sectors. In this project, it will be used in a closed box which will be designed such that the PPE could be easily placed and exposed to the UV-C light. Even though it will be designed to disinfect medical PPE, it could also be used to disinfect any other surfaces such as phones, office supplies and glasses. 
##### c) Who’s going to use it 
UV light sterilization is known to effectively purify the air without the use of hazardous chemicals. UV germicidal technology is especially important in hospitals and other settings where it is integrated into air conditioning systems to sterilize pathogens that cause illnesses and contaminants that can aggravate respiratory conditions. Moreover, UV lamps are used to remove harmful or toxic chemicals produced in many industries and to reduce or eliminate VOCs and industrial exhausts containing solvents. However, this prototype is meant to disinfect surfaces which means it is be used by medical workers to disinfect and re-use PPE and by other individuals who wish to disinfect their personal belongings such as phones, wallets, glasses etc.

##### d) Etc (include all necessary details, describing in natural language the scenario)
###### UVC Implementation
UVC is relatively easy to implement safely in a wide range of situations. Such applications typically fall into two categories: surface disinfection and airflow disinfection. Surface disinfections entails UVC exposure to wall or chamber surfaces, as well as to surfaces of manufactured samples. As long as surfaces to be disinfected are within the line of sight of the lamp, it is fairly simple to select a system with the proper intensity to provide D99+ dosing with a few minutes of UVC exposure. Whole room sanitizers provide this germicidal control for walls, ceiling and floor of a lab, cleanroom or other production space. These units include cycle timers that let a user set the unit for operation and then safely leave the room. Because they require only a few minutes to provide a D99 dosage, they can be operated before and after processing shifts to provide a first line of defense against bioburden accumulation.
Furthermore, there are many industries where surface disinfection without the use of chemicals is critical and UV light sterilization can provide a safe, effective solution.  One example is in the food industry where UV lamps are used for irradiation. Ultraviolet light sterilization kills viruses, bacteria, yeast and fungi in seconds, and can also extend shelf life and nutritional value.  Applications include packaging materials, conveyor belts, transport containers, working surfaces, countertops and on liquid-sugar tanks to kill mold and bacteria. Another promising new development has been with UV hormesis, which is a process that helps to reduce post-harvest losses by delaying the ripening of fruits and vegetables.  The technology offers the potential to save a great deal of money in the future.

### 3. Requirements (High Level)
##### a) Functional
UVC disinfection was tested on SARS-CoV-1 and it have successfully inactivated the virus in 15 minutes (refer to section 5). Based on the International Ultraviolet association, “UVC has been shown to achieve a high level of inactivation of a near-relative of COVID-19’s virus (i.e., SARS-CoV-1)”.[4MM] Therefore, this gives an initial indication of the required exposure time for disinfection of COVID-19. However, the conditions at which the prototype testing is to be done, including dose, intensity, distance from the light as well as the type of infection will have an impact on the required time for disinfection. 
The UV lights which are intended to be used provide UV short waves with a wavelength of 255 nm (UVC). The average D90 dose (exposure) required for coronavirus is 67 J/m2. [5MM] This will result in a value of 8.58E+19 photons/m2 is what the virus will be exposed to. (Refer to section 5) This value appears to be effective in killing germs and viruses which implies that the acquired UVC emitter is effective. 

##### b) Non-Functional 
The box has to be compact in order to efficiently use the radiated light by ensuring that it is concentrating on the infected surface rather than other parts. Moreover, shadowing is an issue as it limits the exposure of surfaces which are not directly facing the light. This introduces the necessity of a reflective inner surface to reflect the light into all parts of the object and so, aluminum foil could be used for that purpose. Moreover, inserting the objects into the box should be easy and so, one surface of the chamber should be easy to open and close to easily access the objects inside. For precautions we will add to thinks, one sensor to turn off the system automatically when the box will be open and also to use interlock relay it's a protection that once the system is switched off it will avoid to turn the system on wile the box is open.




### 4. Brief technical proposal
##### a) Diagrams
##### b) Proposed design:
The proposed design was to be a cubic box with 18 W UV-C lights for disinfection purposes. It went through several modifications in terms of the sizing and lights placement. The final design was a 35 cm cube with two UV-C emitters placed at the top surface. It was sketched on Solidworks as shown below:

The infected object is to be placed in the chamber before closing the door. After closing the door, the lights will be ready switch on to initiate the disinfection process. After a given amount of time, a timer will indicate that the disinfection process is complete. If the door was opened during that process, it will be terminated for safety purposes. The block diagram below shows how the system is going to operate:

##### c) Implementation






##### d) Testing
In order to identify whether the prototype is functional, it was tested with the use of yeast. One gram of yeast was exposed to the UVC light in the chamber and the results were recorded based on the observation of whether any colony was formed in the cup, the environment of formation was 40ml of water and 4g of sugar. 

### 5. References or support material
##### UV light side-effects:
###### Effect on the skin
The shortwave UV radiation (UV-C) poses the maximum risk. The sun emits UV-C but it is absorbed in the ozone layer of the atmosphere before reaching the earth. Therefore, UV-C from the sun does not affect people. Some man-made UV sources also emit UV-C. However, the regulations concerning such sources restrict the UV-C intensity to a minimal level and may have requirements to install special guards or shields and interlocks to prevent exposure to the UV.
###### Effect on the eyes
The eyes are particularly sensitive to UV radiation. Even a short exposure of a few seconds can result in a painful, but temporary condition known as photokeratitis and conjunctivitis. Photokeratitis is a painful condition caused by the inflammation of the cornea of the eye. The eye waters and vision is blurred. Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane that covers the inside of the eyelids and the sclera, the white part of the eyeball); (see Figure 3) which becomes swollen and produces a watery discharge. It causes discomfort rather than pain and does not usually affect vision.
##### Functional Requirements:
	n is the number of photons;
	h is Planck's constant;
	f is the frequency;
	A is the incident area;
	t is time.
	λ is the wavelength
	ϵ energy per photon

UV-C lights (200-280nm) are absorbed by RNA and DNA bases which is the case for the COVID-19. [1MM][2MM] This was tested on the SARS-CoV virus. UVA and UVC lights were directed at the virus stocks placed in a 24-well tissue culture plates. The results are shown in the figure below: 

Based on the testing, it was observed that the UVC light inactivated the virus at a distance of 3 cm for 15 minutes. 

Since the UVC light is expected to disinfect surfaces, it would be reasonable to consider the photon density per unit area. The energy each photon carries is quantum, which is defined as follows: [3MM]
ϵ=hv                                                                                   (1)
Where h is the Planck’s constant in Js, and v is the frequency in Hz. Given that the UVC lamp ordered provides a UV short wave with a wavelength of 255 nm, the frequency can be obtained as follows:
f=c/λ                                                                                      (2)
Where c is the speed of light in ms-1. The frequency will be around 1.18E+15 Hz. Using equation 1, the energy per photon is 7.79E-19□( Joules/Photon) and inverting it gives 1.28E+18 □(Photons/Joule). By multiplying this value with the dose, the photons/area could be determined and used to assess how efficient is this method of disinfection. The average dose required to kill coronavirus is 67 J/m2, which concludes that 8.60E+19 photons are emitted per square meter. [5MM] This value appears to be sufficient to inactivate most viruses. 
Taking into account that the conditions at which the UVC prototype was designed and tested were different, the required dose and time for the proposed design can be obtained as follows:
The box was 35 cm3,  and the infected object is to be placed 27 cm and 8 cm away from the two UVC emitters which provide a power of 18 W each and emit waves with λ=255 nm. Based on the given information, the intensity can be approximated as follows assuming a uniform intensity at all directions:
Intensity=nfh/At                                                                      (3)
The dose can also be found using the following equation:
Dose=Intensity×time                                                             (4)
By inserting equation 3 in 4, the dose can be represented as shown below where the area was approximated to be 20 cm2:
Dose=nfh/A                                                                            (5)
Given the frequency and area, the number of photons can be obtained using the power of the UVC light and the energy per photon which was obtained earlier (7.79E-19□( Joules/Photon)). 
n=(P )/ϵ                                                                                   (6)
Where P is the power on the infected surface which is found as follows:
Power=P_light/(4πr^2 )*A                                                                   (7)
Where r is the distance between the light and A. Using equations 6 and 7, the total number of photons emitted each second was found to be 1.25E+19. Using equation 5, the dose of the lights per second was found to be 19.6 J/m2 and 223.8 J/m2 for the 27 cm and 8 cm radii respectively. Taking into account that the incident area is 0.04 m2 and not 1 m2, this value was scaled down. It was concluded that 0.79 J and 8.95 J were the amount of energy that the incident area will be exposed to from the 27 cm and 8 cm radii respectively. In order to reach 67 J, 92 seconds are required. Even though the average dose to kill a coronavirus is 67 J/m2, it is important to consider the highest dose required, which is 241 J/m2. [5MM] Based on that, 332 seconds will be required to disinfect the object’s surface.
